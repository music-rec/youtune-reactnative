# YouTune

A Youtube Music client for Android, iOS and Web built with React Native that allows you to listen to music from Youtube. (WIP)

## Motivation

This project came about in order to satiate my interests in PWAs and Cross-Platform apps. I also don't like how every serious service that serves music online requires an account in order to get an individual experience. Youtune is a sandbox for me to gather experience in these topics.

## Progress

I'm currently focused on getting Youtune to work reliably for web. Expect the app for other platforms not to work.  
Notable features are:

- Display search results/artist pages/album pages/Lyrics
- Music playback with Media Session API
- Swiping gestures to open/close playback screen and skip songs
- Parallel downloads
- Cache first
- Color based on album cover
- Audio visualizer
- Chromecast support

## Current goals

After implementing a lot of features simply working with vanilla Javascript became very restricting. I want to move the entire project to Typescript to make the code easier to work with and the behavior of future additions more predictable.

## Usage

Clone project with

    git clone https://github.com/youtune-reactnative
